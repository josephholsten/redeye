Current problem with cycle recovery is when a key can
catch some circular errors, but not others. It has no
way of letting the dispatcher know that it no longer
requires the caught key in order to be rescheduled.

Take this case:

z -> a, b
a -> c
b -> c (rescues)
c -> a, b (rescues a, but not b)

There are two cycles: a,c and b,c.
b will resolve its rescue to a value. now, even
though c does not need a to finish in order to
run successfully, the dispatcher will still never
reschedule c.
