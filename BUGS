- sticky cache
  - even though every @get from the sticky cache
    re-blesses the object, asynchronous workers
    could keep a reference to the object, after
    which it gets re-blessed before the worker
    runs again. then using that object would have
    the wrong context.
    > fix: have the blessed methods use something like WorkerQueue.current or some such..
      but how would that get set? hmm, you'd have to totally prevent async abilities
      that bypass the queue, and make sure all queue methods correctly set current
