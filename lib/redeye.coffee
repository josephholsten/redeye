# Red Eye
# =======
# 
# Fast parallel workers
# ---------------------
#
# Red eye workers handle a single job until completion. The runner defined
# by the prefix of the job contains the code to perform the computation.
# The runner uses the context of the worker, and has access to three important
# methods:
# 
# * `@get(key)`: returns named key from the database
# * `@emit(key, value)`: stores value for named key to the database
# 
# The runner function is called with the arguments of the job. It can either
# use `@emit` to indicate its result(s), or it can simply return a single
# result from the function, but not both.
