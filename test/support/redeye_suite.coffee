# The redeye test suite can be used in place of a normal expresso test. It
# handles managing multiple Redis databases, starting and stopping
# the Dispatcher and WorkQueue, and timing of setup versus expectations.
# 
# To use it, instead of a single expresso function, you provide a hash
# that looks like this:
# 
#     redeye_suite = require './support/redeye_suite'
#     
#     module.exports = redeye_suite
#       'name of test':
#         
#         workers:
#           worker_name: (args...) ->
#             # Here you define a normal redeye worker. This is the
#             # same as calling `worker worker_name, (args...) ->`
#         
#         setup:
#           # Use @db to access Redis
#           # Use @request(key) to kick off the redeye tasks
#           # Access @dispatcher to add custom event handling
#         
#         expect:
#           # Use @db and @assert to test your workers
#           # Be sure to call @finish() when you're done
# 
# You can see examples in `redeye/test/*_test.coffee`.

  #  - Chooses a unique Redis db index and channel namespace
  #  - Flushes the database at the start of the test
  #  - Starts a Dispatcher and a WorkQueue
  #  - Uses the `setup` key to initialize the test
  #  - Waits until the WorkQueue terminates, then calls `expect`
  #  - Has an emergency timeout that kills the redeye processes
  #  - Waits on `@finish` to be called to complete the test
